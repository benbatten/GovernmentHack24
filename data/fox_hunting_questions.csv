To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what is his Department's policy on fox hunting for the armed forces.,Fox Hunting 1995
"Given the widespread public opposition to the hunting of wild animals, what possible justification can there be for allowing members of the armed forces to participate in fox hunts during duty hours? When will the taxpayer stop subsidising that appalling and barbaric sport? Why does not the Minister act now to end the waste of public money?",Fox Hunting 1995
"Does the Minister accept that mob rule and class war should not be allowed to stop the Army doing something that is perfectly legal throughout the country? Does he further accept that the Army is popular in my constituency, that hunting is good exercise for horses and that there is something inherently noble and nothing cruel in the great and glorious death of a fox in the field?",Fox Hunting 1995
"Has an investigation been made of the activities of the Linlithgow and Stirling hunt following my recent letter to the Lord Advocate? Is the hon. and learned Gentleman aware of the blatant discrimination against some of my constituents who were arrested after a nonviolent, anti-hunt protest, such as blowing hunting horns, whereas members of the hunt and their supporters were allowed to use obstruction and violence? Is the hon. and learned Gentleman aware that a mounted policeman, who took part in the hunt, seemed to be taking orders from the master of the hunt? Is it not time that something was done to stop police protection being given to upper-class thugs and hooligans who take part in such a cruel blood sport?",Fox-Hunting: 1981
Will the Department of Agriculture find any objection if farmers take this matter in hand themselves and destroy the foxes?,Fox And Stag-Hunting: 1940
"asked the Minister of Agriculture if he is aware that fox and stag-hunting damages agriculture, handicaps the food supply, discourages the allotment industry, takes away fit men and women from productive work, and so is detrimental to the national interests; and will he take steps to procure its prohibition?",Fox And Stag-Hunting: 1940
"Nor is it easy to see how this provision is to be enforced by the police against an individual dog owner or dog walker. I suspect that only mounted police would be effectiveâ€”which might be an interesting exchange for huntingâ€”and they would need the permission of the landowner or occupier except where there were bridle paths as well as footpaths and they were open, which at the moment they are not.","Hunting Bill
"
"Can only the prosecutor make that authorisation, or can a person with the written agreement of the prosecutor, under the earlier clause, make such agreement? If that were so, we should be somewhat at arm's length.",Protection Of Animals (Amendment) Bill
"The final question that I want to flag up at present relates to clause 4. It states:
the prosecutor is entitled to be reimbursed.
However, it does not say by whom or from what source, it simply makes the statement. From where will reimbursement come?",Protection Of Animals (Amendment) Bill
"Intriguingly, subsection (2) states:
Any amount for which the prosecutor is entitled to be reimbursed under subsection (1) may be recovered by him from the owner summarily as a civil debt.
That may be so, but what if it is not? That may be the hope, but does it cover all eventualities? Some legal guidance may be necessaryâ€”",Protection Of Animals (Amendment) Bill
"For example, sometimes animals other than farm animals which are involved in commercial activity appear to be covered by the Bill; at others, it seems that the same species of animals are exempt from the provisions of the Bill, such as those in catteries or kennels, circuses or zoos. What about puppy farms?",Protection Of Animals (Amendment) Bill
"It appears that the filters provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food which will prevent vexatious prosecutions by those with direct authorisations to proceed are probably effective. But how does the Minister propose to deal with possible abuses of the powers of entry by those with delegated authority?",Protection Of Animals (Amendment) Bill
Does an animal bred at home and subsequently given to a pet shop for commercial sale count as an animal kept for commercial purposes? ,Protection Of Animals (Amendment) Bill
"The Bill would allow the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or the National Assembly for Wales to enter into contractual arrangements with corporate bodies to act as prosecutors under the Bill. It is envisaged that the RSPCA, for example, will be appointed to that role. I am concerned that not enough control will be exercised on the appointment of the individual officers by such bodies. Would it not be more sensible for the appointments to be made directly by the Ministry from a panel of appropriately qualified and vetted individuals? ",Protection Of Animals (Amendment) Bill
"My final point, which was also raised in another place, is whether the Bill can provide adequate compensation for owners who have had their livestock removed and possibly sold or destroyed but who are subsequently acquitted in proceedings under the 1911 Act. That is unclear. Although the court has to have regard to the owner's interest in the value of the animals and in avoiding increasing the costs when making an order, what happens if it transpires that an entirely innocent party has suffered what could be a serious financial loss as a direct result of the exercise of those powers?",Protection Of Animals (Amendment) Bill
"Both my noble friend and the exemplary Explanatory Notes make a point of saying that although Clause 3 allows very necessary powers of entry, those powers do not extend to private dwelling houses. Why not?",Protection Of Animals (Amendment) Bill
"We know that companies, for instance, usually complain that the cost of the receiver vastly exceeds the normal cost of running a business. How does she derive the confidence that the cost of looking after the animal away from the farmer concerned will be commensurate only with that he himself would have had to incur?",Protection Of Animals (Amendment) Bill
"Wider facilities are available, which raises another issue that should be considered in detail in Committee. Are animals kept in modern facilities covered adequately by the 1911 Act? We are not necessarily dealing with primates, birds or some of the species that we normally see in zoos; much more exotic creatures, especially amphibians and mammals, may not be adequately covered by that Act.",Protection Of Animals (Amendment) Bill
